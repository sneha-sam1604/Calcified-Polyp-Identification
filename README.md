# Calcified-Polyp-Identification
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for binary image classification using Keras. It includes data augmentation, model training, validation, and saving of trained weights. The project is structured to classify images into two categories with improved generalization through real-time image transformations.
